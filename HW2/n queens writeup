Vanilla DFS
(I modified where iterations and moves are counted, as made sense to me. See comments in code)

British Museum
Simply re-shuffles the board and checks if it’s a solution.

Heuristic Repair
Begins with a random board, and then finds the row that has the most conflicts, and places it in a the position that minimizes conflicts. If we are stuck— no such column exists that can improve this worst row, I just reshuffle the board. This quick to quick method seems to have worked better than the

Forward Checking + Most constrained
(The more robust algorithm that allows for any order of rows also makes it easy to change the 1st row placed. As documented below this significantly impacts performance, but the metric for best starting place is not obvious to me. For example here it appears that size/2 is a good metric, but for n=20 I found 13 ti be the best starting position.)
