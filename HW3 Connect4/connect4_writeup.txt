My code consists of several agents which play the provided connect4 implementation.
The provided agents are as follows:
    MoveRandom- This was already provided. The agent chooses a valid spot fully randomly
    muskenu-- Semi-random. The agent checks for any immediate wins or losses and avoids them.
    eval-- uses the eval function to execute 1 level of forward checking.
    minimax_agent-- uses minimax to choose a spot.
    ab_agent-- usues alpha-beta pruning to choose a spot.
    hakham-- Shortcuts calling ab_agent in case of immediate win/loss or a potential double trap.
    (The above ordering should roughly follow the 'difficulty' of each agent.)

Minimax and ab_agent use a helper function eval which returs a huristic score for the given board.
    It works by
    giving strong weight to a win,loss or double trap
    and otherwise sums all the values of all series of 4 in the board (In all directions.)
